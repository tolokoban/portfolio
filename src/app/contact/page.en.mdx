# Contact

I am a fullstack web developer (_Javascript, CSS, WebGL2, Typescript, React, Webpack, Rust, PHP, Python, ..._)
with extensive experience in interactive scientific imaging (2D/3D) and geographic applications.

I develop for the desktop browser as well as for mobiles (Android and iOS).

I work as much as possible with open source software (_Blender, Krita, ..._).
