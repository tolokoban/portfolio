# HandsOnWebGL

For a student visit, we decided to prepare a hands-on lab to explain what the visualization team in Blue Brain Project was doing.

It was a one-hour session, so we focused on exercises around a simple use case: displaying a simulation of electrical signals propagating along the dendrites of a neuron.

The GLSL code is compiled on the fly, and the result is displayed immediately. This way, students can experiment and learn faster.

[Try a 3 minutes demo](apps/hands-on-webgl/index.html). Works best on a not too small screen.
