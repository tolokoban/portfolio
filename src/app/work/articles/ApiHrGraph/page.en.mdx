# ApiHR Graph

Mister Bob's job is to help clients with many human resources software by providing them with a single interface to rule them all.
During the first interview, mister Bob and the client will list all these software and the data flow between them.

To do this, mister Bob wanted a web-based graph editor suited to their needs. This way they would make the first interview more engaging.

[You can take a look at the graph editor](apps/apihr-graph).
Click on the pencil in the screen's bottom left corner to edit the graph.

It is like a concept artist would work with a film producer.
Bob has an idea of what they want, so you start with a sketch and collect feedback. You provide another sketch, collect more feedback, and the loop keeps going on until we agree on the final design.
