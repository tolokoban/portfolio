To simulate the mouse brains, scientists create **circuits**.

Circuits are sets of neurons, glial cells, vasculatures, ...
Because the mouse's brain can have 80 million neurons, we use a backend to ray trace them.

The web app is a mix between local rendering (in WebGL) and images rendered remotely on super computers.
