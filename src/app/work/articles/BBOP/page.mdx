This big project is the achievement of the 18 years of existence of the laboratory.

I was among a medium team of 10 frontend developers, one UX designer, one QA engineer and several backend developers.

I worked on some of the dialogs of the app, on the integration of the remote ray tracer and on the WebGL mophology viewer.
