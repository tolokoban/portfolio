Because of the curled shape of the Hippocampus, scientists do not use Cartesian coordinates, but a system that is closer to the structure of this brain region of the mouse.

To match with orthonormal Cartesian coordinates, we use volumes in NRRD format, which are huge matrices generated by programs.

The web viewer I wrote reads the coordinates in the voxels of these volumes and applies them to the shape of the Hippocampus.

This way, researchers can visually verify that their calculations are correct.
