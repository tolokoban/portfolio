The Open Deck is a giant semi-circular screen that has 8 4K overhead projectors.

This application allows you to control each projector,
as well as the audio and cooling system.
All from your mobile phone.

To do this, we created a REST server in Python that we access via WebSocket.

The design is responsive: it adapts to all screen sizes and orientations.
