# Fractal Ferns

<Image />

To draw a fractal fern, you have to start from a point at position `(0,0)`,
apply a formula to determine the coordinates of the next point, and
repeat this process a few million times.

Each time you land on a pixel, you increase its color value.
If you land on the same pixel 127 times, it becomes completely white.

Note that only green pixels are calculated. The red ones are just from a
central symmetry.

You can create your own ferns with this [application](https://tolokoban.github.io/fern).

The number of pixels to calculate being colossal, it would be too slow to do this in Javascript.
So we compiled a **Rust** program in **Web Assembly**.
