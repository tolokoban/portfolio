This riddle by Sam Loyd was published by his son in 1914.

It's about finding the simplest/cleverest solution.

## Preliminary study

To start, let's see what happens if both ferries are going at the same speed.
To do this, we use a two-dimensional time diagram:
the time on the abscissa and the distance on the ordinate.

<CrossingBoats speed={1} pause={10} />

We see that the boats cross exactly in the middle of the river.
Both outward and return.
We deduce that the boats are not going at the same speed since they cross
at 720 meters then at 400 meters.
We will therefore assume that the first boat is going at a speed of 1 and the second at a
speed `1 / V` with `0 < V < 1`.

Now, let's look at how the pause time influences the problem.

<CrossingBoats speed={2 / 3} pause={10} />
<CrossingBoats speed={2 / 3} pause={5} tail={5} />
<CrossingBoats speed={2 / 3} tail={10} />

In fact, as the break is the same for both boats, it seems that we can
just translate the return part and don't change anything at the intersection.

**But beware**!
This no longer works if the second boat passes the first again before even having
was able to cross the river. And this happens if `V <= 1/2`.

<CrossingBoats speed={1 / 3} pause={10} />
<CrossingBoats speed={1 / 3} pause={5} tail={5} />

## Simple case: `1/2 < V < 1`

In this case, we have seen that the pause times can be ignored.
So our problem can be represented by this diagram:

<Schema />

The two light triangles are similar since they have two angles
of the same measure. We therefore deduce the following equality:

```
720×(2V - 1) = 400×V <=> V = 9 / 13
```

`V` is between 1/2 and 1, so we are in the simple case.

We just need to find the height (`h`) of the dark triangle.
Since it is similar to the two clear triangles, we deduce:

```
V×h = 720 <=> h = 1040
```

The width of the river is therefore `1040 + 720 = ` **`1760` meters**.

## A simpler solution

The previous solution had us calculate the relative speed of the two boats.
But this information is not requested in the puzzle.
So maybe we can get away with it.

Imagine a variant of the problem in which when the boats pass each other
they go back. Kind of like they were bouncing off each other.

Here are the time diagrams of the two variants of the problem:

We now see that during the second crossing, the orange boat
traveled three times the distance between its bank and the meeting point,
i.e. `3 * 720 = 2160` meters.

And we know from the statement of the problem that during this second meeting,
the orange boat crossed the river completely and advanced further
400 meters.

The width of the river is therefore `2160 - 400 = 1760` meters.
