# Tournus

In an understaffed school canteen, parents have to come and help with the service 3 or 4 times per year.

I was in charge of collecting the parents constraints and write down a planning as flexible as possible.

Examples of constraints are:

-   I can come only on Tuesday.
-   I can never come on Thursday and will be busy on March and April.

I fed an algorithm of mine with all these constraints, and it produced a
[static web page](apps/tournus/index.html) with the planning for everyone
and a list of people that can exchange place on any day.
